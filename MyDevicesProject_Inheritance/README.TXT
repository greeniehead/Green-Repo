After seeing the need for an inheritance hierarchy that will
allow us to create an ArrayList of both MyPhone and MyPod objects,
we add the MyDevice superclass and then create an ArraList of 
MyDevices that can "hold" both MyPhone and MyPod object.

This allow us to polymorphically process seemingly different
objects together in one loop.
